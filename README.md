# Bubbling

**Description:**
Creating a JavaScript bubbles animation

[Live page](https://gruximillian.github.io/BubbleTrouble/)

**To try speech recognition, you must run this on a server.**

Here's how to set up a quick server:

* Download the code and extract it into a folder. Let's name the folder `bubble-trouble`.
* Next, change working directory to that folder: `cd ~/bubble-trouble` if it is in your home directory
* run `npm install` to install dependencies
* run `npm start` to start the server, this will run your default browser and the page can be accessed on `localhost:3000`

**NOTE:** Speech recognition only work in Chrome at this moment, so make sure you test it in Chrome.

P.S. Have fun!
